# Covid-19_X-Ray_Image_Processing

The Covid-19 epidemic has had an unparalleled impact on the entire world.The increase in cases brought on by virus mutations after almost two years since the SARS-CoV-2 virus was initially discovered is a serious public health concern for everyone in the world. Because of this health emergency, forecasting the virus's pattern of transmission is one of the most important responsibilities for preventing and containing the pandemic.For successfully anticipating the trend of the number of SARS-CoV-2 patients,machine learning technologies, in addition to mathematical models, deep learning models in particular have been developed.In this project a multiclass Covid-19 prediction into 3 different classes Normal,Viral Pneumonia and Covid-19.This work presents a comparison four deep learning architectures, namely Xception ,Resnet50 , DenseNet,light-weight-CNN .The experimental outcomesXception demonstrate that it outperforms existing methods. In order to help medical professionals treat COVID-19 patients, our method will provide a quicker and more precise patient screening process.
